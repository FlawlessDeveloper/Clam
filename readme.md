Fractals created by this program can be viewed [here](https://khyperia.com/fractals.html)

Note this program is not user-friendly at all, and is very specialized to my own use cases. However, if you do want to
run it yourself, the standard `cargo run --release` is how to do so. Pressing `h` will at least dump a list of
keybindings to console :)
